# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple, single-file web application that converts a Markdown file (`input.md`) into HTML and renders it directly in the browser. It's built with modern web technologies, including:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For a responsive and modern design.
- **Marked.js**: A fast Markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript.

## Features

- Converts `input.md` to HTML dynamically.
- Renders the HTML output within the page.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Setup and Usage

To use this application, follow these simple steps:

1.  Ensure you have `index.html` and `input.md` (the Markdown file you wish to convert) in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The application will automatically fetch `input.md`, convert its content to HTML, and display it on the page.
